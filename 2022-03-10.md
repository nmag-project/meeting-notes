# Meeting Notes 2022-03-10

- Moved meeting time 3.5 hours earlier
- Start taking meeting notes and create a repository to archive them:
https://github.com/nmag-project/meeting-notes
- People are interested in using docker. Madison will create a video on how to build and use it.
- Venkat will backport the changes from the github.io (https://github.com/nmag-project/nmag-project.github.io) html to the website generator repository (https://github.com/nmag-project/website-generator). Ask Hans for any help with rest2web
- Madison will create a makefile to replace build.sh in the website generator repository. There will be a `debug` target that will drop the user into the container.

## Randomly observed issues
