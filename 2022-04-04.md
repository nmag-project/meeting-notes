# Meeting notes 2022-04-04

- Madison made the changes to the website generator repository that were outlined last meeting.
- Madison will create a how-to video on using the nmag Docker image
- Madison will update the nmag-container repo README to include steps on pulling from Dockerhub.

## Carry-over issues

- Venkat will backport the changes from the github.io (https://github.com/nmag-project/nmag-project.github.io) html to the website generator repository (https://github.com/nmag-project/website-generator). Ask Hans for any help with rest2web
- search function html docs doesn't work: https://nmag.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Unclear how the read-the-docs site was created. Linking a sphinx project to readthedocs is explained at https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/read-the-docs.html
- source in https://github.com/nmag-project/nmag-doc/blob/master/nmag/Makefile
- Create a diff of packages on the system before and after installing nmag dependencies on ubuntu 12.04. We should host the binaries from these packages ourselves.
